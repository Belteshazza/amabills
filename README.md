## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

TASK DETAILS
1. A user can create an account, login to their dashboard, and reset their forgotten password. This authentication system should be a tokenized system that will expire at a certain time range.

2. A user can have many products and many products can only belong to one user demonstrating ( one-to-many ) relationships.

3. Users products should have [ NAME, DESCRIPTION, QUANTITY, UNIT PRICE, AMOUNT_SOLD etc ] as attributes. ( Use appropriate dataType for all fields )

4. Products can be updated and deleted by the owner. A user is not allowed to update or delete products that don't belong to them.

5. Products should be listed with pagination and in DESC order.

6. Create a github Repository and push your code and share this repository when done.

7. Demonstrate proper documentation standards by documenting your APIs using postman.
